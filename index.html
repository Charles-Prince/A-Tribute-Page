         <p>Paul the Apostle, commonly known as Saint Paul  </p>
            <p> Also known by his Hebrew name Saul of Tarsus was a Christian apostle </p>
                <p> Who spread the teachings of Jesus in the first-century world </p>
            
           <p> According to the New Testament book Acts of the Apostles, </p>
                <p> Paul was a Pharisee who  participated in the persecution of early disciples of Jesus </p>
                     <p> Possibly Hellenised diaspora Jews converted to Christianity in the area of Jerusalem, prior to his conversion </p>
            
            <p> In the narrative of Acts, </p>
               <p> Paul was traveling on the road from Jerusalem to Damascus </p>
                   <p> On a mission to "arrest them and bring them back to Jerusalem" </p>
                   <p> when the risen Christ appeared to him in a great bright light </p>
                    <p> He was struck blind, but after three days his sight was restored by Ananias of Damascus </p>
                    <p> Paul began to preach that Jesus of Nazareth was the Messiah and the Son of God. </p>
            
           <p>Fourteen of the 27 books in the New Testament are attributed to Saint Paul. </p>
           <p> Today, Paul's epistles continue to be vital roots of the theology,</p>
            <p>  Worship and pastoral life in the Latin and Protestant traditions of the West</p>
                <p>As well as the Eastern Catholic and Orthodox traditions of the East. </p>
